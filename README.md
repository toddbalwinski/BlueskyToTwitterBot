# BlueskyToTwitterBot
A bot that takes all of a users posts on Bluesky and automatically reposts them onto X(Twitter).
I had originally wanted for this bot to do the opposite process (repost from X onto Bluesky) but with X's new API fetching posts is only availble on a paid plan of $200 a month. While this defeats the original purpose of the project of helping boster early bluesky with content from well known twitter accounts, it still allows me to learn and play with both APIs.
